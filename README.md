# *minishell*

## Description
This project is a shell implementation that challenges students to create a simple command-line interpreter. The goal is to replicate some of the basic functionalities of a Unix shell, allowing users to run commands, manage processes, and handle input/output redirection.

## Features
- **Command Execution**: Executes shell commands and manages processes.
- **Built-in Commands**: Implements built-in shell commands such as `echo`, `cd`, `pwd`, and more.
- **Input/Output Redirection**: Supports basic input/output redirection with `<` and `>`.
- **Pipelines**: Handles command pipelines with `|` for chaining multiple commands.
- **Environment Variable Expansion**: Expands environment variables in command arguments.
